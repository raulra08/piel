#Piel
Public Interest Environmental Law (PIEL) UK was formed in 2007 by students from various University of London colleges as an unincorporated association and now brings together students from several London universities. Its cause is to champion and raise awareness of environmental justice issues by organising the annual PIEL UK Conference.

#iOS Piel app
Raul Rodriguez created a simple and static app which main objective is to provide information about the annual PIEL UK Conference.
The app mainly shows the schedule for the conference as well as the speakers that will participate, the topic they will talk about and some biography.
